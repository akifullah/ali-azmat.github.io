                            <p><strong>My guitar, my bike and my fans</strong> without them I’m not me”. This single quote defines the whole life circle of <strong>Ali Azmat</strong> – without whom Pakistani music industry would not be standing where it is now.

                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Ali</strong> stepped in Pakistani music arena when there was very little media penetration in the masses. Most of the singers who chose to pick up ‘pop’ music, preferred to go solo. And they are treated as icons themselves. <strong>Ali</strong> bravely took up the challenge and used his originality to make his presence felt. Started with one of the first rock/pop bands of the country, ‘Jupiters’, Ali gave the music industry the ever green song, ‘<strong>Dosti</strong>’.
                            </p>
                            <p>In 1990, Ali started the most famous and accredited band of South Asia, <strong>‘Junoon’, as lead vocalist</strong>. This was the actual start of legendary career of Ali. The music produced by Junoon marked a new chapter in the music industry. It was a beautiful and mesmerizing blend of rock and sufi music. Junoon also produced a few hits based on socio-political issue of the country. Over a decade, Junoon produced around 20 albums. For which 20 million copies were sold worldwide.</p>
                            
                            <p>In 1999, Junoon won the “<strong>Best International Group</strong>” award at the <strong>Channel [V] Music Awards</strong> in New Delhi. In 2001 Ali appeared in the VH1 News Special Islamabad Rock City, a rockumentary on Junoon hosted by Susan Sarandon. In October 2001, he sang it again, this time on the floor of the United Nations General Assembly with an Indian band. The New York, Times and the Village Voice among others wrote rave reviews of his performance, the only rock concert ever held at the UN. In 2002, Ali was nominated for an <strong>Emmy award</strong>.</p>
